# Documentation for .env File

Welcome to the documentation for the `.env` file of our project. This file is crucial for configuring environment variables used by our application.

## Purpose

The `.env` file is used to store sensitive or environment-specific configuration variables. These variables are typically used to configure the behavior of our application in different environments, such as development, staging, and production.

## File Structure

The `.env` file typically follows a simple key-value pair structure, where each line represents a single environment variable in the format `KEY=VALUE`. Here's an example:

```plaintext
USER_DIGIFLAZZ    = xxx 
API_KEY_DIGIFLAZZ = xxx
URL_DIGIFLAZZ     = https://api.digiflazz.com/v1/

TOKEN_API = xxx
API_KEY_PAYDISINI = xxx
